To begin selling products using FluxVend, you need to set up your first store location. A store location is a physical location where you will be selling your products. It is important to set up your store location before adding products to your store.

<control> Stock management</control>, <control>purchase order</control> and <control>sales</control> are all tied to a store location, 
so it is important to set this up as it is required to complete the setup of your desktop terminal.

## Setting Up Your First Location

To set up your first store location, follow the steps below:

<procedure>
    <step> Log in to the FluxVend Admin Portal using your username and password.</step>
    <step> Click on the <control>Inventory</control> menu on the left-hand side of the page to expand the inventory sub-menu.</step>
    <step> Click on the <control>Locations</control> sub-menu to view a list of store locations associated with your business.</step>
    <step> You will be greeted with a message that says "No locations found". Click on the <control>Create</control> button to open the location creation form.</step>
    <step> Fill in the details for your store location, including the <control>Location Name</control>, <control>Address</control>, <control>email</control>, and <control>phone number</control>.</step>
    <step> Also select the <control>Location Type</control> from the dropdown menu. The location type can be a <control>Store</control>, <control>Warehouse</control>, or <control>Distribution Center</control>.</step>
    <step> For the purpose of this guide, we will select <control>Store</control> as the location type as the desktop terminal can only be associated with a store location.</step>
    <step> Click the <control>Create</control> button to save the location details.</step>
    <step> You have successfully created your first store location.</step>
</procedure>
