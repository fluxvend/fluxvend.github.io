    <step> In the list of users, you will see your user account. Click on your user account to view the user details.</step>
    <step> In the user details page, you will see a role selection dropdown. Currently, your user account has the role of <control>Admin</control> by default. This role has access to only user management features and subscription management.</step>
    <step> To grant full access to your user account, select the <control>Super User</control> role from the dropdown menu.</step>
    <step> Click the <control>Update</control> button to save the changes.</step>

Now that you have successfully granted permissions to your user account, you will notice that you have full access to the FluxVend Admin Portal. 
The next step is to [setup your store location](Setting-Up-Your-First-Location.md). A store location is a physical location where you will be selling your products and it is important to set this up before adding products to your store.
