# Setting Up a Test Environment

## Introduction

To facilitate development and testing without affecting live data, Fluxvend provides a dedicated test environment. This environment mirrors the production system and offers the same features, allowing developers to experiment and test their integrations with our APIs and webhooks.

## Accessing the Test Environment

### Creating a Test Account

1. **Visit the Test Environment Portal:**
    - Go to [dev.fluxvend.com](https://dev.fluxvend.com).

2. **Sign Up for an Account:**
    - Click on the “Sign Up” or “Create Account” button.
    - Follow the registration process to create your test account.

3. **Login:**
    - Use your newly created credentials to log in to the test environment.

### Features

- The test environment provides an exact replica of the features available on [www.fluxvend.com](https://www.fluxvend.com).
- You can explore and utilize all the features, APIs, and webhooks as you would in a production environment.

## Data Management

- **Temporary Data:**
    - Note that the data in the test environment is temporary and will be automatically removed after a few days.
    - This is to ensure that the environment remains clean and efficient for all users.

- **Extended Testing:**
    - If you require more time for testing beyond the automatic data removal period, please contact support.

### Contact Support

- **Email:** [support@fluxvend.com](mailto:support@fluxvend.com)
- **Request Extension:**
    - When contacting support, provide details about your testing needs and the reasons for requiring an extension.

## Important Notes

- **Testing Scope:**
    - Ensure you are aware that the data and transactions are not real and will be deleted. Any changes or tests performed will not affect the production environment.

- **Environment Behavior:**
    - Be mindful that the test environment is designed for testing purposes and may have different performance characteristics compared to the production environment.

- **API Keys and Webhooks:**
    - API keys and webhooks used in the test environment are separate from those in the production environment. Ensure you generate and use test keys specifically for the dev environment.
